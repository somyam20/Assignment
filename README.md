The provided code is designed to generate synthetic financial transaction and credit bureau report data for a set of customers to mimic real-world bank statements and credit reports. Here's how it works:

First, a list of customer names is created, and each customer is assigned a random customer ID. Then, a variety of transaction categories like Salary Credit, Shopping, Food & Dining, Loan EMI Payments, Utility Bills, Cash Withdrawals, and Bank Transfers are defined to simulate realistic transaction types. For each customer, the code generates a random set of transactions. Each transaction includes details such as the transaction date, type, description, and amount.

To make the data more realistic, 10% of the transactions are intentionally made inconsistent. This could mean leaving out a description or transaction amount to simulate the messy, real-world nature of financial data. The transaction dates are selected randomly within the last year, and different formats like "YYYY-MM-DD," "DD/MM/YYYY," or "Mon DD, YYYY" are used. This variation in date formats further introduces inconsistencies.

Along with the transaction data, the code also generates a credit bureau report for each customer. This report includes information such as the credit score, active loans, credit utilization, missed payments, total debt, and debt-to-income ratio. These values are randomly assigned within realistic ranges, ensuring that the data reflects actual financial conditions.

Once the data for all customers is generated, it is converted into Pandas DataFrames for easy manipulation and processing. The data is then saved as CSV files for future use.

The goal of this approach is to create synthetic data that closely resembles real-world financial data, while still allowing flexibility in the number of customers and transactions generated. The inclusion of inconsistencies, random values, and varying formats makes the dataset a good representation of the messy nature of real-world data. This is especially useful for testing tasks like ETL pipelines or machine learning models, which need to handle imperfect or inconsistent data in real-world scenarios.

TASK 1
The provided code is part of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to clean and process financial transactions and credit bureau report data. Let me break down the steps for you.

First, the raw data is loaded from the provided CSV files into Pandas DataFrames for easier manipulation. This is the "Extract" step of the ETL process. The next focus is on cleaning the data to ensure it's consistent and ready for analysis.

A key transformation is standardizing the date column. Since the data might contain various date formats (like "YYYY-MM-DD," "DD/MM/YYYY," and "Mon DD, YYYY"), a function is used to convert all the dates into a consistent "YYYY-MM-DD" format. If any date doesn't match the specified formats, the function returns NaN for invalid entries, ensuring that only valid date formats remain in the dataset.

Next, the code handles missing transaction descriptions. If any description is missing (i.e., it’s a NaN value), the code fills it with the placeholder string "Unknown Transaction." This ensures that there are no transactions with empty descriptions, which could cause issues in future analysis or processing.

For the Amount column, any missing values are filled with the median value of the amounts. This is done to keep the data consistent and avoid introducing bias, as filling with zeros or random values could skew the results.

Another important step is cleaning the transaction descriptions. A function is used to remove any non-alphanumeric characters (like special characters or punctuation) and convert all descriptions to lowercase. This ensures that descriptions are uniform, which helps in avoiding discrepancies during analysis or when querying the data.

After performing these transformations, the cleaned transaction data is saved to a new CSV file called "cleanedfinancialdata.csv". Similarly, the credit report data is also cleaned and saved, making both datasets ready for the next step, which is loading them into a database (such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for efficient querying and processing.

The process of standardizing and cleaning the data is crucial because it ensures data consistency and quality. This is important for any future tasks like database queries, reporting, or building machine learning models. By dealing with missing values, standardizing formats, and cleaning descriptions, the pipeline effectively handles real-world data inconsistencies.

Although the code doesn't include the database storage part (PostgreSQL/MongoDB), the cleaned data is now ready for loading into a database. This makes the next steps in the ETL pipeline (loading data into a database) easier to implement.

As for the bonus task of deploying the ETL pipeline on AWS, that could involve using services like AWS Lambda, Glue, or Airflow to automate the pipeline. This would allow the pipeline to run at scale, handling millions of transactions efficiently in a cloud environment.
TASK 2
The code I'm explaining is an implementation of a transaction categorization model that uses regular expressions (regex) to classify bank transactions into predefined categories like "Salary," "Food & Dining," "Utilities," "Loan EMI," and "Shopping." The goal of this task is to categorize unstructured transaction descriptions, which often come in various formats, into appropriate categories.

To begin with, I created a sample dataset of transactions stored in a dictionary. This dataset is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame, which makes it easy to manipulate and process the data. To categorize each transaction, I defined a dictionary of predefined categories, where each category is linked to a regex pattern that matches common keywords associated with that category. For instance:

The "Salary" category would be matched by keywords like "salary," "credit," or "infosys."

The "Food & Dining" category would match keywords such as "swiggy," "zomato," etc.

The categorize_transaction function then iterates through the dictionary of categories and applies the corresponding regex patterns to the transaction description. If a pattern matches, the transaction is classified under the respective category. If no pattern matches, the transaction is labeled as "Other."

Once I applied this function to each transaction in the dataset, I added a new column called "Category" to the DataFrame. This column contains the respective category label for each transaction. After this process, the dataset is transformed to show the transactions alongside their categories, making it easier to understand and analyze.

This approach leverages basic NLP techniques—specifically regex—to classify transaction descriptions efficiently. It works well in cases where the data is somewhat structured or when transaction descriptions follow recognizable patterns. However, it's important to note that this is just a starting point. For better accuracy, especially when dealing with more complex or unstructured descriptions, advanced NLP models like SpaCy, FastText, or BERT could be used. These models can capture deeper semantic meanings in the transaction descriptions, leading to more accurate categorization.

I should also mention that the code provided doesn't include API deployment, even though that's a bonus task. If we wanted to deploy this model as an API, we could use frameworks like Flask or FastAPI, which would allow us to classify transactions in real-time by accepting incoming requests and sending responses. However, since I'm not yet familiar with API deployment, setting this up would require additional learning and some effort to set up routes and handle requests. Additionally, if I wanted to improve the model's accuracy, I could integrate pre-trained embeddings like BERT, TF-IDF, or Word2Vec, which would involve further steps to train the model and enhance its ability to categorize transactions effectively.

This is a simple, but effective approach for categorizing financial transactions in cases where the descriptions are relatively predictable.
 TASK 3
 In this task, I built a machine learning pipeline to predict the risk level of customers based on their credit report data The goal was to classify customers as either at risk (Risk = 1) or not at risk (Risk = 0) based on their credit score and other financial features.

First, I loaded the cleaned credit report dataset using pd.read_csv and printed the first few rows to inspect the data. I then addressed missing values by filling the missing numerical data with the median of the respective columns using fillna. This helps avoid outliers affecting the data, as the median is more robust than the mean.

Next, I created a new column called "Risk" based on the customers' credit scores. If the credit score was below 600, the customer was marked as at risk (Risk = 1), and otherwise, as not at risk (Risk = 0). This was done using a lambda function applied to the "Credit Score" column.

For the feature selection, I chose relevant predictors such as credit score, debt-to-income ratio, missed payments, credit utilization, and total debt. I then separated the target variable, "Risk," from the features and handled any missing data in the features by filling them with the mean of the respective columns.

Since many machine learning algorithms perform better when features are on the same scale, I used StandardScaler to standardize the features, ensuring they had a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

I also checked the class distribution in the training set. If the minority class had fewer than 10 instances, I used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, helping to balance the class distribution. This was particularly important for improving the model's performance on imbalanced data, which is common in risk prediction tasks.

For model training, I opted for a Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning model that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. I trained the model on the resampled training data (after applying SMOTE, if necessary) and evaluated it using accuracy scores and a classification report that provided detailed metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and support for both classes (Risk = 0 and Risk = 1). The zero_division=1 argument was used to avoid errors in metric calculations when there are no samples of a particular class in the prediction.

Overall, the approach I used involved systematic handling of missing data, scaling the features, addressing class imbalance, and using a robust Random Forest model for classification. While the model performed well, further improvements could include hyperparameter tuning of the Random Forest or experimenting with different models for better performance.
TASK 4- I have No Experience in APIs But I will Learn More about this.
TASK 5 
I attempted to fine-tune an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) for the transaction categorization task, but unfortunately, it didn't work out due to several issues. One of the primary challenges was the model's size and resource requirements. Fine-tuning LLMs is computationally intensive, and due to hardware limitations, such as insufficient RAM and processing power on our current system, the process couldn't be completed successfully. Specifically, the models were too large to be effectively processed on a CPU, and the RAM usage spiked, leading to crashes or failure to load the models properly.
Additionally, there were issues related to optimizing the models for our specific task, such as ensuring that the model could generalize well to the various types of transaction descriptions in our synthetic dataset. These factors made it difficult to deploy the model effectively within the resources available, and it was not able to meet our expectations for accuracy or efficiency.
Given these challenges, we are exploring alternative approaches, such as simplifying the model or utilizing more efficient architectures, and we may consider using cloud platforms with better computational resources to handle the fine-tuning and inference processes.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a popular tool in Python used for working with text. One of its important features is tokenization, which means splitting text into smaller parts like sentences or words.

Here are some useful tokenizing functions in NLTK:

1. word_tokenize – Breaks text into words and punctuation marks.


2. sent_tokenize – Splits a paragraph into separate sentences.


3. RegexpTokenizer – Lets you split text using your own rules or patterns.


4. WhitespaceTokenizer – Breaks text based on spaces only.


5. TweetTokenizer – Made for handling tweets, emojis, hashtags, and short messages.

Lemmatization and stemming are two ways to reduce words to their root form, which helps in processing and understanding text better in NLP.

How They Work:

Stemming removes the end of a word to get its base form. It doesn’t check if the result is a real word. For example, "running", "runs", and "runner" might all become "run" or "runn". It works by chopping off suffixes using basic rules.

Lemmatization looks at the word’s meaning and part of speech (like noun or verb). It uses a dictionary to find the correct root word, called the lemma. For example, "better" becomes "good", and "running" becomes "run".


Functions in NLTK:

Stemming Function:
PorterStemmer – A common stemmer that applies simple rules to cut words.
(e.g., "PorterStemmer().stem('running')returns'run'`)

Lemmatization Function:
WordNetLemmatizer – Uses the WordNet dictionary to find the correct base form of a word.
(e.g., WordNetLemmatizer().lemmatize('running', pos='v') returns 'run')



---

Summary:
Stemming is faster but less accurate, while lemmatization gives better and more meaningful results. Both are helpful for reducing different forms of a word into one form before analyzing text.

str.lower() – Converts text to lowercase.

re.sub() – Removes punctuation, numbers, or extra spaces using regular expressions.

string.punctuation – A list of punctuation marks that can be removed.
stopwords.words() – Gives a list of stopwords in a language.
Here’s a simple explanation of functions used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) in NLP using NLTK and related tools:


---

1. Named Entity Recognition (NER):

What it is:
NER is used to find and classify names in text – like people, places, organizations, dates, etc.

Common functions:

ne_chunk() – Performs named entity recognition on a chunked sentence.

pos_tag() – Tags each word with its part of speech (needed before NER).

word_tokenize() – Breaks text into words (used before POS tagging).


Together, these help extract named entities from text.


---

2. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):

What it is:
WSD is about finding the correct meaning of a word based on its context (e.g., "bank" as a riverbank or a money bank).

Common function:

lesk() – Comes from the nltk.wsd module and tries to find the best meaning (sense) of a word in a sentence using the Lesk algorithm.

It compares the word’s context with dictionary definitions to pick the most likely meaning.



---

Summary:
NER helps recognize important names in text, while WSD helps understand the correct meaning of words with multiple senses. Both are important for making machines understand human language better.

generate() – A function in transformer models like GPT-2, GPT-3, or T5 that creates text from a starting input.

pipeline('text-generation') – A Hugging Face pipeline that wraps around models to make text generation easier.
gensim.summarize() – Extracts key sentences from the text to create a summary (used for extractive summarization).

Transformers like Bart or T5 – Used for abstractive summarization using models from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

What is it?
Bag of Words is a way to turn text into numbers so that a computer can understand and use it in models. It looks at which words are in the text and how many times they appear, but it does not care about the order of the words.


---

How It Works:

1. Collect Text – Start with a few sentences or documents.


2. Split into Words – Break the sentences into individual words (this is called tokenization).


3. Build a Word List – Make a list of all the unique words from the text (this is your vocabulary).


4. Count Words – For each sentence, count how many times each word in the list appears.



This gives you a set of numbers (called a vector) for each sentence or document.


---

Why It’s Called “Bag” of Words:

Because it doesn’t care about the order of the words — just like a real bag doesn’t care how you place items in it.


---

Functions Used (from scikit-learn):

CountVectorizer() – This is the main tool used to apply Bag of Words in Python. It:

Breaks sentences into words,

Creates a word list (vocabulary),

Turns sentences into word count numbers.


fit() – Learns the words from your text.

transform() – Converts new text into numbers using the learned words.

fit_transform() – Does both steps together.
\subsection{TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)}

TF-IDF is a numerical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It combines two metrics: Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).

\subsubsection*{1. Term Frequency (TF)}

Term Frequency measures how frequently a term appears in a document. It is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{TF}(t, d) = \frac{f_{t,d}}{N_d}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item f_{t,d} is the number of times term t appears in document d,
    \item N_d is the total number of terms in document d.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{2. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)}

IDF measures how important a term is across the entire corpus. Rare terms across documents get higher scores. It is calculated as:

\[
\text{IDF}(t) = \log \left( \frac{N}{1 + n_t} \right)
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item N is the total number of documents in the corpus,
    \item n_t is the number of documents containing the term t,
    \item 1 is added in the denominator to avoid division by zero.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{3. TF-IDF Calculation}

The final TF-IDF score for a term t in document d is given by:

\[
\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \text{TF}(t, d) \times \text{IDF}(t)
\]

\subsubsection*{4. Use in NLP}

TF-IDF is commonly used to convert text into numerical features. It helps highlight words that are important in a specific document but not common across all documents, which improves the performance of text classification, clustering, and search algorithms.

\subsection{BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)}

BERT is a deep learning model developed by Google for understanding the meaning of words in context. It is based on the Transformer architecture and is designed to handle various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification, question answering, and named entity recognition.

\subsubsection*{1. What is BERT?}

BERT stands for \textbf{Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers}. Unlike earlier models that read text either left-to-right or right-to-left, BERT reads text in both directions at the same time. This allows it to understand the full context of a word based on all surrounding words, not just the ones before or after it.

\subsubsection*{2. Pre-training Tasks}

BERT is first trained on two unsupervised tasks using a large text corpus:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Masked Language Modeling (MLM)}: Random words in a sentence are replaced with a [MASK] token, and the model learns to predict the missing words.\\
    Example: \textit{``The cat sat on the [MASK].''} → Model predicts: \textit{``mat''}
    
    \item \textbf{Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)}: The model is given two sentences and learns to predict whether the second sentence naturally follows the first.\\
    Example: \textit{``I went to the market.'' ``I bought vegetables.''} → Is next sentence? \textit{Yes}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{3. Architecture Overview}

BERT uses only the \textbf{encoder} part of the Transformer model. It consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks. Each layer allows the model to focus on different parts of a sentence and learn deeper relationships.

\subsubsection*{4. Tokenization}

BERT uses a special method called \textbf{WordPiece Tokenization}, which breaks words into sub-word units. This helps it handle unknown or rare words by understanding them as combinations of smaller, known parts.

Example: \textit{``unhappiness''} → \textit{``un'', ``##happiness''}

\subsubsection*{5. Input Format}

BERT inputs are formatted as:

\[
[\text{CLS}], \text{Token}_1, \text{Token}_2, ..., \text{Token}_n, [\text{SEP}]
\]

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{[CLS]} – Special token at the beginning, used for classification tasks.
    \item \textbf{[SEP]} – Special token used to separate two sentences.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{6. Fine-tuning}

After pre-training, BERT is fine-tuned on specific NLP tasks by adding a small task-specific layer on top of the model. The entire model is trained further on a smaller dataset to perform tasks like:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sentiment Analysis
    \item Question Answering
    \item Text Classification
    \item Named Entity Recognition
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{7. Benefits of BERT}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Captures context from both directions (left and right).
    \item Pre-trained on a massive dataset, which improves performance on smaller datasets.
    \item Works well for a wide range of NLP tasks with minimal changes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{8. Popular Variants}

Some well-known BERT-based models include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DistilBERT} – A smaller, faster version of BERT.
    \item \textbf{RoBERTa} – A robustly optimized version of BERT with improved training techniques.
    \item \textbf{ALBERT} – A lighter version that reduces memory usage and increases speed.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)}

TF-IDF is a numerical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It combines two metrics: Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).

\subsubsection*{1. Term Frequency (TF)}

Term Frequency measures how frequently a term appears in a document. It is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{TF}(t, d) = \frac{f_{t,d}}{N_d}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f_{t,d}$ is the number of times term $t$ appears in document $d$,
    \item $N_d$ is the total number of terms in document $d$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{2. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)}

IDF measures how important a term is across the entire corpus. Rare terms across documents get higher scores. It is calculated as:

\[
\text{IDF}(t) = \log \left( \frac{N}{1 + n_t} \right)
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$ is the total number of documents in the corpus,
    \item $n_t$ is the number of documents containing the term $t$,
    \item $1$ is added in the denominator to avoid division by zero.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{3. TF-IDF Calculation}

The final TF-IDF score for a term $t$ in document $d$ is given by:

\[
\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \text{TF}(t, d) \times \text{IDF}(t)
\]

\subsubsection*{4. Use in NLP}

TF-IDF is commonly used to convert text into numerical features. It helps highlight words that are important in a specific document but not common across all documents. This is useful in tasks like text classification, clustering, and search engines.
